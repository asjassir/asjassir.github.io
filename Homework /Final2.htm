          <p style="width:600px; padding-left:400px;"> As temperatures drop and the days shift decisively into autumn, foodies out there may be wondering what seasonal delicacies are available in October. How about some British Red Grouse, served with Shetland Black Potatoes, Musselburgh leeks and a a few Kentish cobnuts on the side? These are all suggestions from Slow Food UK’s seasonal calendar which is packed full of the finest heritage products from England, Scotland and Wales.

More and more people are being drawn to the principles and benefits of local and seasonal food, or as the Slow Food movement has it, ‘Good, Clean, Fair food’. Not only do you eat produce at its freshest and tastiest, but you also support the businesses of local friends and families. Ancient varieties are protected and carbon miles are reduced. There is also a strong social element to the movement, encouraging people to get together and enjoy simple food and to understand the processes involved in its production and ensuring that land and livestock are treated well.

Before the turn of the century, we lost touch with our food, it was all about being cheap </p>

   <p style="width:600px; padding-left:400px;">and fast. In 1981 the United States Department of Agriculture proposed ketchup should formally be classified as a vegetable. Founded in 1989 by Carlo Petrini, the Slow Food movement sought to make a stand against this creeping dominance of fast food and the damaging effect it had not only on our health, but our connection with the land, the economy and each other. Now the movement involves millions of people in over 150 countries.

Their flagship event is the Salone del Gusto, held biennially in Turin, Italy. Imagine a farmers market visited by 180,000 people, a global conference and a communal celebration of good food and eating and you have some idea of what will be happening from the 23rd-27th October this year.

You might think that in these straightened times, the impact of the collapsed economy would mean a decrease in the amount or organic food bought, but according to the Organic Market Report 2014, sales increased by 2.8% in 2013 and four out of five households buy organic products.

‘We are now waiting for a new school of economic thought,’ says Petrini. ‘But these new schools can only emerge, like plants, if you prepare the ground.’ Plenty of groundwork has been done already, though, including the development of the ‘Ark of Taste,’ a collection of heritage varieties of fruits, vegetables, animal breeds, cheeses, breads, sweets and cured meats. Currently with 1925 products listed worldwide, the Ark of Taste seeks to draw our attention to how easily these varieties might become extinct and invites us to work together to preserve and celebrate them.

If there is one place to start with the Slow Food movement, maybe it should be with your fridge freezer. Although the average man on the street is these days more aware of food wastage, we still have a compulsion to fill our fridges with food we have no real plan for. It sits there, moulders, goes off and then we throw it away. There is usually even a grey area in between where the food has passed the point where we would be prepared to eat it, but we don’t yet feel ready to throw it away. Familiar? If so, next time you go food shopping, think: rather than packing your fridge with insipid out-of-season foods flown from half-way around the world, how about treating yourself to a few, choice, seasonal and locally sourced items, that you cook that very day and enjoy every last mouthful? The Slow Food movement might take its time, but it is very definitely here to stay. </p>
